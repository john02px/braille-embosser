# A Quieter and More Efficient Camshaft-Powered Braille Embosser 

**Introduction:**\
This project explores an camshaft-based approach to enhance braille embossers, addressing the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals. Traditional braille embossers are costly and noisy, hindering personal use. The proposed solution employs a camshaft system to improve efficiency, reduce noise, and lower costs. Unlike commercial alternatives ($2000-$5000) that require sound dampening, this camshaft-powered embosser operates quietly and is economically accessible at around 1000 RMB (approximately $160). The experiments conducted demonstrate the viability of this design, showcasing its potential as an affordable and effective braille embossing solution.

## Background

There are an estimated 43 million blind individuals worldwide, 233 million that are living with moderate to severe visual impairment.Visually impaired individuals rely on the use of braille letters instead of alphanumeric letters to write and read.Braille Characters are composed of a 2*3 grid of raised dots to form characters and can be generated through refreshable braille displays, manual braille writing slates, or braille embossers. Braille embossers are used to produce large amount of permanent braille characters.
